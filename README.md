- Variables are used to store information.
- A variable is a "named storage" for data. We can use variables to store data.
- To create a variable in JS, we need to use the let or var keyword.
- A string in JS is a set of characters surrounded by quotation marks.
- Always rember to close a string with the same type of quotation marks you 
started with.
